            { file: "2C_magma.html",val:"Dwelling Place", title: "2C. Within the Scorching Magma", desc: "Each line of text forms rocks floating on magma. In 1982, hyperthermophilic bacteria were discovered in a region where lava and seawater mixed near Vulcano Island, Italy. These microorganisms can survive even in scorching magma." },
            { file: "2D_geography.html", val:"Dwelling Place",title: "2D. A 100M Years Beneath the Layers", desc: "Microorganisms have been found in sediment samples extracted from strata dating back 100 million years. Some microorganisms survive by remaining dormant and enduring between layers without movement." },

Although microbes themselves remain unseen, their effects—like changes in body conditions—become visible, much like the shift in color to gray." },

A Crowded Existence", desc: "While individual microorganisms are invisible to the naked eye, their colonies can sometimes be seen. When they reach a visible density, it often indicates that environmental conditions have surpassed a critical threshold, warranting caution." },

What Happens When You Touch? - mouse hover", desc: "Some microorganisms react when touched by expanding parts of their bodies or moving. This variation represents such behavior, with words gradually enlarging when hovered over with the mouse." },

Some Drawn Closer, Others Pushed Away - mouse click", desc: "Some photosynthetic microorganisms exhibit phototaxis, moving toward light sources. However, excessively strong light can be harmful to them, causing them to move away. In this variation, clicking a location simulates the presence of light, with some microorganisms being drawn to it and others repelled, representing their phototactic behavior." },
            { file: "4C_mouseGather.html", val:"Sensory System of Microbes in Webpage",title: "4C. Following You - mouse XY", desc: "Words follow the mouse pointer." },

What Lies Unseen - mouse click & drag", desc: "Although we are often unaware of microorganisms, they exist everywhere. This variation expresses their omnipresence by making lines of poetry about microbes appear one by one when the screen is clicked and dragged" },

In this variation, different lines symbolize different microorganisms, illustrating their distinct division cycles as they split at varying times." },
            { file: "5B_lifespan.html", val:"Lifespan of Microbes",title: "5B. Microbial Chronicles", desc: "Technically, microorganisms do not have a defined lifespan. Instead, the time it takes for one to divide into two is considered a 'generation time'. Some microbes discovered in 100-million-year-old sediments may have lacked even the energy to divide, potentially remaining in a single generation for an extended period. This variation represents different microorganisms' generation times through the varying lengths of text along the x-axis." },
            { file: "5C_lifeLength.html", val:"Lifespan of Microbes",title: "5C. Diverse Lifespans", desc: "Our existence is built upon life inherited continuously from unicellular organisms. This variation expresses the continuity of life’s history by manipulating font density, position, and size to create a three-dimensional form." },
            { file: "5D_separating.html", val:"Lifespan of Microbes",title: "5D. Divide, Divide, Divide", desc: "The process of microbial division is represented by a poem that starts as a single unit and gradually splits apart into separate components." }
