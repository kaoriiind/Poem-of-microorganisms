In 1982, hyperthermophilic bacteria were discovered in a region where lava and seawater mixed near Vulcano Island, Italy. These microorganisms can survive even in scorching magma." },

Instead, the time it takes for one to divide into two is considered a 'generation time'. Some microbes discovered in 100-million-year-old sediments may have lacked even the energy to divide, potentially remaining in a single generation for an extended period.
