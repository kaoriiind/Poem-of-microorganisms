        A mighty creature is the germ,<br>
        Though smaller than the pachyderm.<br>
        His customary dwelling place<br>
        Is deep within the human race.<br>
        His childish pride he often pleases<br>
        By giving people strange diseases.<br>
        Do you, my poppet, feel infirm?<br>
        You probably contain a germ.
