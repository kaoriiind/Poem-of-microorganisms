        A mighty creature is the germ,
        Though smaller than the pachyderm.
        His customary dwelling place
        Is deep within the human race.
        His childish pride he often pleases
        By giving people strange diseases.
        Do you, my poppet, feel infirm?
        You probably contain a germ.
